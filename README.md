# Express Note Taking App
A virtual notepad powered by Express.js

## The Goal
An interactive app that allows the user to write and save notes to a JSON database file. The notes can be saved, opened and deleted from the user interface.

## What I Did 
1. Set up the Express app with all relevant middleware.
2. Created routes to html pages for navigation.
3. Used GET and POST requests to retrieve and display existing note data, as well as write new data to db.json.
4. Used a DELETE request to allow user to remove notes.
